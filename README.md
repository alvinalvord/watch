# Watch two youtube streams at the same time
basically I don't have enough screens

so i made this and now i can watch 4 streams per screen

# how to use
- copy the video url(e.g. https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ) or just the id (e.g.dQw4w9WgXcQ)
- paste the url on the input field then enter/submit

Note: At most 2 urls or ids, separated by a ',' per tab of this thing (e.g. dQw4w9WgXcQ,dQw4w9WgXcQ)
